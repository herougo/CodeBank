# Unsorted Area of Code Bank

This is where people can post code without worrying about refactoring first. This is meant to gather as much code as possible (especially when contributors don't have much time to spare). 

Furthermore, this is used in the more early stage of Code Bank when proper APIs are being figured out (code is experimental). Once there is enough code and API pros and cons have been learned for a particular feature, the code can be integrated into the actual repo.

### Folder Structure:

- **copied**: Code you did not write yourself (e.g. found on the internet)
- **past_henri**: Existing code Henri wrote that can be integrated with Code Bank in the future.
- Files not in the above folders are meant to collect implementations of certain basic functionality (e.g. image_augmentation collects all snippets relating to image_augmentation).


### General Notes for contributing code:

- leave a comment mentioning the author and whether it matches an existing Code Bank API
- avoid global variables if you can
- data loaders go in the **datasets** folder as a new file with the same interface as the others.
